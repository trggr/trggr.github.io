      HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE

             Eb         Gm7     Fm7
I know your eyes in the morning sun
C7          Fm7             G7   Abmaj7(Bb)
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
        Eb              Gm7    Cm7
And the moment that you wander far from me
        Fm7                 Abmaj7(Bb)
I wanna feel you in my arms again

       Abmaj7           Gm7
And you come to me on a summer breeze
        Fm7                         Db9
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
        Gm7           Abmaj7(Bb)
And it's me you need to show
                  Eb
How deep is your love


    Ebmaj7            Abmaj7           Abm6 
How deep is your love I really mean to learn
              Eb                 Gm7-5(Db)           C7
'Cause we're living in a world of fools breaking us down
                            Fm7
When they all should let us be
     Abm6            Eb
We belong to you and me


I believe in you, you know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest night
You're my savior when I fall.

And you may not think I care for you,
When you know down inside that I really do.
And it's me you need to show -
How deep is your love.
