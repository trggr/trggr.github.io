                        "How Deep Is Your Love"
                    (Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb)

	             Eb         Gm7     Fm7
	I know your eyes in the morning sun
	C7          Fm7             G7   Abmaj7(Bb)
	I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
	        Eb              Gm7    Cm7
	And the moment that you wander far from me
	        Fm7                 Abmaj7(Bb)
	I wanna feel you in my arms again

	       Abmaj7           Gm7
	And you come to me on a summer breeze
	        Fm7                         Db9
	Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
	        Gm7           Abmaj7(Bb)
	And it's me you need to show
	                  Eb
	How deep is your love


	    Ebmaj7            Abmaj7           Abm6 
	How deep is your love I really mean to learn
	              Eb                 Gm7-5(Db)           C7
	'Cause we're living in a world of fools breaking us down
	                            Fm7
	When they all should let us be
	     Abm6            Eb
	We belong to you and me

Verse 2:

	I believe in you
	You know the door to my very soul
	You're the light in my deepest, darkest night
	You're my savior when I fall

	And you may not think I care for you
	When you know down inside that I really do
	And it's me you need to show
	How deep is your love
