    It's colder and sunny,
    And I am out of money,
    Still trying to catch to the world.

    The dog wyned insomny,
    But now on his tummy
    Relaxed to the nature's accord.

    Perhaps we will go 
    To the dog park together
    Unleashed to run 'round and to bark.

    To bathe in the evening
    And being a relieving,
    For tomorrow we swim with the sharks.
